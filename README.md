## ⭐  About
Cryptoscapes started out from a few skills I wanted to learn and practice over my summer break from college, the state management library, [Redux][2], [atomic design][3], and project management.

After tinkering with a bunch of cryptocurrency data with Redux, I eventually decided to create a simple UI to display this data, through the use of charts and graphs in a clean dashboard. Some of the visualisations seen also involve further manipulation of the data, such as a [heatmap][4] displaying metric correlations between cryptocurrencies. 

The result was Cryptoscapes, an information dashboard that displays prices, trends, status updates, market snapshots and much more. Visit the website at [cryptoscapes.org][1] to check it out!
